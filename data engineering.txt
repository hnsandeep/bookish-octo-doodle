1. Data Ingestion:
Real-time Data Ingestion:
Utilize a stream processing framework such as Apache Kafka for real-time ingestion.
Implement Kafka producers to handle ad impressions (JSON) and bid requests (Avro) data.
Set up Kafka topics for each data type (impressions, bid requests).
Develop Kafka consumers to process and store the incoming data.
Batch Data Ingestion:
Use a batch processing framework (e.g., Apache Spark, Apache Flink) for batch data ingestion.
Implement jobs to ingest click and conversion data (CSV) periodically.
Store batch data in a staging area for further processing.
2. Data Processing:
Standardization and Enrichment:
Use Apache Kafka Connect or custom processors to standardize incoming data formats.
Apply transformations to enrich data with additional information (e.g., campaign details, user demographics).
Validate data integrity and discard invalid or incomplete records.
Correlation of Data:
Implement a data correlation mechanism to link ad impressions with clicks and conversions.
Use unique identifiers (e.g., user ID, ad creative ID) for correlation.
Enrich ad impressions data with click and conversion information.
3. Data Storage and Query Performance:
Data Storage Solution:
Choose a data warehouse or database optimized for analytical queries (e.g., Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, Apache Druid).
Create tables to store standardized and enriched data, partitioned by time for efficient querying.
Optimization for Analytical Queries:
Implement indexing on columns frequently used in queries.
Use materialized views for pre-aggregated data to speed up analytical queries.
Consider data compression techniques to optimize storage.
4. Error Handling and Monitoring:
Error Handling:
Implement a robust error-handling mechanism in the data processing pipeline.
Set up dead-letter queues to capture and analyze failed records for troubleshooting.
Monitoring System:
Use monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to track pipeline performance metrics.
Set up alerts for anomalies, delays, or discrepancies in data processing.
Integrate logging mechanisms to capture detailed information for debugging.
Additional Considerations:
Implement data partitioning and bucketing to optimize data storage and retrieval.
Design an archival strategy for historical data storage.
Regularly review and update the data processing pipeline to accommodate evolving business requirements.
